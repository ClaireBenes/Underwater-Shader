# Underwater Shader  

A visual experiment using shaders to create an **underwater effect**, including **animated water, fish movement, and terrain generation**. 
This project explores **noise functions**, **perlin noise**, and **shader-based rendering** to achieve a dynamic underwater scene.

## 🛠️ Features  

- **Noise-based water shaders** – Simulates the movement and distortion of water.  
- **Procedural fish animation** – Uses a noisefield to create natural-looking fish movement.  
- **Terrain generation** – Implements Perlin noise for realistic underwater ground formations.
